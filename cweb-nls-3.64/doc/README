      The  CWEB-NLS  System  of  Literate  Programming  for  C

   The CWEB-NLS provides change files to be applied to literate programs 
`cweave.w' and `ctangle.w' from the CWEB package (version 3.43)
by Silvio Levy and Donald E. Knuth.
   The main purpose of the CWEB-NLS change files is to add national
language support to `cweave' and `ctangle' making them usable to literate
programmers who want to communicate in languages other than English.
Additionally, changed programs use the path searching mechanism which
is provided by `Kpathsea' library.
   To compile, programs require the GNU `gettext' library and C library
supporting locales. For example, they were successfully compiled by 
the author on RedHat, Debian and Slackware installations of the GNU Linux.
   Currently, only the Polish language is supported. For typesetting Polish
TeX sources, CWB-NLS use TCX reencoding mechanism which is provided by Web2C.

Please send comments, suggestions, etc. to <matwb@univ.gda.pl>.

THE CONTENTS OF THE `CWEB-NLS' PACKAGE


This directory contains the following files:

   README      -- this file
   INSTALL 
   Makefile
   com-sort.ch -- implements multilingual sorting mechanism
   cw-sort.ch     (uses locales)
   com-msg.ch  -- implements support for multilingual message catalogs
   ct-msg.ch      (uses GNU gettext library)
   cw-msg.ch   
   com-ban.ch  -- changes limbo and banner line; hopefully, only these
   ct-ban.ch      files should be changed when new CWEB will appear
   cw-ban.ch   
   com-kpse.ch -- implements path searching mechanism which Kpathsea
   ct-kpse.ch     library provides (requires extension to the source 
   cw-kpse.ch     code of Kpathsea, see ../kpathsea-cweb)
        
The subdirectory `tex' contains the following files:

   Makefile
   cweb-nls.tex -- the driver macro file used when creating localized 
                   macro files
   cweb-nls.msg -- template for messages to be translated
   template.tex -- `localized' macro file
   cweb.map     -- maps language name onto format and tcx file names
   cwebmac.tex  -- a copy of the file from CWEB (for convenience)
   cweb-c.tex   -- extra macros
   pl_PL.msg    -- Polish translations of CWEB messages
   pl_PL.def    -- extra macros for the Polish language

The subdirectory `po' contains the following files:

   Makefile
   cweb-nls.po -- `portable object' file with English messages
		  to be translated
   pl_PL.po    -- Polish translations of English messages

The subdirectory `tests/pl_PL' contains the following files:

   Makefile
   test.w      -- tests if sorting according to Polish locale works
   test_ok.idx -- index sorted on the author machine
   test_ok.scn -- section names sorted on the author machine
   coll_ok.tab -- collating tables for Polish language

The subdirectory `../examples/pl_PL' contains simple examples of 
literate programs written in Polish:

   hello.w     -- traditional `hello world' program
   sample.w    -- generating a random sample of integers
   fw.w        -- counts word frequency
   palindrom.w -- checks if a word is a palindrome (includes all
                  palindromes found in the English `ispell' dictionary)

and `Makefile' which makes compilation easier.
